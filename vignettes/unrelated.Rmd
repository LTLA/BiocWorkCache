# Introduction

I feel that **Porco Rosso** is one of the more underrated Ghibli films.

# Method

I guess maybe that's just because I like airplanes - the soundtrack is also nice.

```{r}
X <- runif(1000, 0, 1)
summary(X)
```

# Results

Most Ghibli films have a young female protagonist^[And yes, Sophie from **Howl's Moving Castle** counts "young".], so it's nice to have a bitter middle-aged man for a change.

```{r}
hist(X)
```

# Discussion

The pirate characters were also amusing.

# Session information

```{r}
