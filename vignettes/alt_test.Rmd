# Introduction

**Grave of the Fireflies** is definitely one to keep on the shelf.

# Method

It is an excellent movie but not something to watch for casual entertainment.

```{r}
Z <- rgamma(1000, 1,1)
summary(Z)
```

# Results

It doesn't help that you know it's going to end badly at the start of the movie.

```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
se <- readRDS(file="castle_in_the_sky.rds")
se
```

# Discussion

In that respect, it is much like **In This Corner of the World**, another one of those emotionally awkward movies.

# Session information

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
