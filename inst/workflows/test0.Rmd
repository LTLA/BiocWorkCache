# Introduction

When talking about Ghibli, you can't go past **My Neighbor Totoro**.

# Method

It's classic slice-of-life with a bit of magic thrown in.

```{r}
Y <- runif(1000)
mean(Y)
```

# Results

The Cat Bus is particularly memorable. 
Looks pretty comfortable if you don't have motion sickness and aren't allergic to cats.

```{r}
se <- readRDS(drake::file_in("castle_in_the_sky.rds"))
se$blob <- runif(ncol(se))
se
```

# Discussion

The moral of the story is - offer your umbrella to others, even if they're a bit weird.

```{r}
saveRDS(se, file=drake::file_out("my_neighbor_totoro.rds"))
```

# Session information

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
