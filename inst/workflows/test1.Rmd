# Introduction

One of my favorite movies of all time is **Castle in the Sky**.

# Method

I'm a big sucker for airships and floating stuff, and the soundtrack is stellar.

```{r}
X <- rnorm(1000)
summary(X)
```

# Results

Did you know that the bad guy was voiced by Mark Hamill in the English dub?

```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
se <- SummarizedExperiment(list(counts=matrix(runif(1000), ncol=10)))
se$blah <- sample(LETTERS, ncol(se))
se
```

# Discussion

I actually have a **Castle in the Sky** T-shirt, though it's subtle enough that most people don't get the reference.

```{r}
saveRDS(se, file=drake::file_out("castle_in_the_sky.rds"))
```

# Session information

```{r}
